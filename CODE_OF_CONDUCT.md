# Code of Conduct

This repository follows the [IndieWeb living code of conduct](https://indieweb.org/code-of-conduct). You can read the whole thing at that link, but here's the tl;dr from that page:

> Be respectful of other people, respectfully ask people to stop if you are bothered, and if you can't resolve an issue, contact staff. If you are being a problem, it will be apparent and you'll be asked to leave.
